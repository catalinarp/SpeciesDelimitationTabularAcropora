## Informative tables
<b>Characters.txt</b><br>
Quantitative and qualitative characters used for morphological taxonomic assessment of tabular <i>Acropora</i> specimens (table S1).<br>
Color (1) was assessed from field observation and photographs from each of the colonies. The rest of the descriptive (qualitative) characters (2 – 16) were recorded from overall observation of skeleton fragments. Morphometrical (quantitative and categorical) characters (17 – 19) were measured directly from the branches using Vernier calipers. Corallite features (20 – 27) were obtained using a stereo microscope and an ocular graticule (except for 23 that was counted from above). B= branch, AC= axial corallite, RC= radial corallite, R= radius.

<b>Descriptive_coding.txt</b><br>
Descriptive variables were re-coded as characters for the analyses according to this file. Re-coded file saved as: QLDescriptiveData_recodedDEP.txt
