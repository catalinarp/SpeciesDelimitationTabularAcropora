<i>Characters.txt</i><br>
Quantitative and qualitative characters used for morphological taxonomic assessment of tabular <i>Acropora</i> specimens (table S1).<br>
Color (1) was assessed from field observation and photographs from each of the colonies. Descriptive characters (2 – 16) were recorded from overall observation of skeletal fragments. Morphometrical characters (17 – 19) were measured directly from the branches using Vernier calipers. Corallite features (20 – 27) were obtained using a stereo microscope and an ocular graticule (except for 23 that was counted from above).Qual= qualitative variables, Quan= quantitative variables, B= branch, AC= axial corallite, RC= radial corallite, R= radius.
