# <b>Molecular species delimitation</b>

This folder contains the files and commands used for molecular species delimitation both using target-capture sequencing data and Sanger sequencing of PCR-based amplificated markers derived from target enrichment.

## Target-capture sequencing


## Sanger sequencing
Chromatograms and alignments used for molecular analyses.


<b>Summary of techniques, loci and methods used in the different stages of the molecular analyses performed in this study.</b> Detailed information about the techniques, the number of loci, the number of individual samples, and the general pre-processing steps and downstream analyses used in each stage of the molecular approaches used in this study.
