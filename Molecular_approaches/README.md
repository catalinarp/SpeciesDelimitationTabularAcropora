# <b>Molecular species delimitation</b>

This folder contains the files and commands used for molecular species delimitation both using target-capture sequencing data and Sanger sequencing of PCR-based amplificated markers derived from target enrichment.

## Target-capture sequencing


## Sanger sequencing
Chromatograms and alignments used for molecular analyses.
